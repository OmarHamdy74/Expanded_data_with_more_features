# Expanded Data with More Features – SVM Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores an extended dataset with additional features to analyze the performance of LinearRegression. 

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Synthetic data generation with increased features.
- Introduction of class overlap and noise.
- LinearRegression model training and evaluation.
- Visualization of decision boundaries and performance metrics.

This work is part of an exploration into the limitations and behavior of SVM classifiers under more complex and less ideal data conditions.
